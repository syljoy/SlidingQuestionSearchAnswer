# Sliding Question Search Answer

Inspired by Youdao Translator's Sliding word translation, use the Python programming language to develop a program for Sliding-question search answer.

Searching for answers may seriously inert students' thinking, so this program is only used for learning programming, and is never used for contest answering.

Remember: **Industry is good at diligence, waste in play, action in thinking, destroyed in following.**
